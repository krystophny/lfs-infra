# LFS Patches Directory

Store patches for upstream packages here. Create subdirectories named
after packages, with patches numbered for application order:

    patches/
    ├── glibc/
    │   ├── 001-fix-locale.patch
    │   └── 002-performance.patch
    ├── gcc/
    │   └── 001-lfs-version.patch
    └── linux/
        └── 001-config-tweak.patch

Patches are automatically applied by build-lfs.sh during extraction.
Use `patch -p1` format (unified diff with a/ b/ prefixes).

Generate patches with:
    diff -Naur original/ modified/ > patches/pkgname/001-description.patch

Or from git:
    git diff > patches/pkgname/001-description.patch
